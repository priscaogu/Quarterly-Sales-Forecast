### Business Problem

As the supply chain analyst, I am tasked with forecasting monthly sales data to synchronize supply with demand. This involves running the numbers through a time series forecasting model to aid decision-making and measure company performance. Currently, I am preparing to provide a forecast for the next 4 months of sales.


### Solution
In this project, I will develop ARIMA and ETS models to forecast quarterly sales.
